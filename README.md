### How do I get set up? ###

* Setup
	* The projects are of IntellJ origin. You may want to install that if you'd like to use [IntelliJ](http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) for development or you don't want to hassle with project files.
	* You will need JDK 7. Feel free to use Oracle JDK or OpenJDK - just so long as it's 7.
	* For the android project (Raspberry Pi Data Hub), you'll need the Android SDK. I don't know what packages you'll need yet, but Android SDK is definitely necessary. :-)

* Configuration
	* You shouldn't need to configure anything other than your JDK and Android SDK if necessary. You may need Putty or OpenSSH or something similar for interfacing with a raspberry pi to test the raspberry pi project.
* Dependencies
	* Will be in the repository.
* Deployment instructions
	* For the android project, you'll need to deploy through either ADB or package the application and send it as an APK. I've never done this, so there may be some kinds in this process I'm unaware of. For the other two - deploy as a packaged jar file.
