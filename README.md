### Overview ###

This project is for the Milwaukee School of Engineering SuperMileage Team, a subset of SAE. The goal is to build a functional data acquisition system for Prototype Electric and Gas Vehicles for compete in the [Shell Eco-Marathon](http://www.shell.com/global/environment-society/ecomarathon/events/americas.html) and [SAE Supermileage](http://students.sae.org/cds/supermileage/) collegiate design and engineering competitions.

The system consists of an android phone as a HUD (heads up display) USB Tethered to a [Raspberry PI](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) that collects data on various sensors connected to the GPIO.
