### What is this repository for? ###

* This is the main repository for the Data Acquisition Module. The repository contains projects for the android application, the raspberry pi application, and the web server.
* If you would like to edit this page, first [learn markdown](https://bitbucket.org/tutorials/markdowndemo).

### How do I get set up? ###

* Setup
	* The projects are of [IntellJ](http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) origin. You can use another IDE or text editor if you so choose, so long as you do not commit other non-intellij project files or temporary backup files. Feel free to add them to the .gitignore
	* You will need JDK 7. Feel free to use Oracle JDK or OpenJDK. Android does not support Java 8 as of Oct 12, 2014.
	* For the android project (Raspberry Pi Data Hub), you'll need the Android SDK. I don't know what packages you'll need yet, but Android SDK is definitely necessary. :-)

* Configuration
	* You shouldn't need to configure anything other than your JDK and Android SDK if necessary. You may need Putty or OpenSSH or something similar for interfacing with a raspberry pi to test the raspberry pi project.
* Dependencies
	* Will be in the repository.
* Deployment instructions
	* For the android project, you'll need to deploy through either ADB or package the application and send it as an APK. I've never done this, so there may be some kinds in this process I'm unaware of. For the other two - deploy as a packaged jar file.
